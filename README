My implementation of Conway's game of Life in Java! The world is set to be a fixed 600x600 grid, and as a result changing the height factor changes the zoom on the top-left corner of the world. The delay field specifies how much time to pause between each generation in milliseconds. By default it is set at 50 milliseconds.

To run the program, type the following in the command line:
java -jar GameOfLife.jar [text file]

By default the test.txt file is used. To specify a seed pattern, create a new text file and populate it with 1's (alive cells) and 0's (dead cells). Unfortunately the way I have the file reader currently set up, is the the seed pattern must be rectangular (I may change this at some point).
